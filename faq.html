<h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-the-climate-and-how-does-it-work-">What is the climate? And how does it work?</h2>
<p>The climate is what we call the long-term pattern of weather in any particular area. Different regions have different climates and they’re determined by a regions climate system. The climate system is the combination of the atmosphere (air), hydrosphere (water), cryosphere (ice and snow), lithosphere (land surface) and the biosphere (everything living). </p>
<h2 id="what-are-greenhouse-gases-how-do-they-affect-our-climate-">What are greenhouse gases? How do they affect our climate?</h2>
<p>There are many kinds of greenhouse gases. The most common are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and water vapour (H2O). They’re called greenhouse gases because in the atmosphere—the envelope of air that surrounds earth—their molecules trap and slowly release heat energy, like a greenhouse does.</p>
<p>Without the greenhouse effect, the heat from the sun wouldn’t hang around long, and scientists predict that the average temperature of Earth would go from 14˚C to about -18˚C. Our planet has had a natural greenhouse effect since long before the industrial revolution (when we began emitting mass amounts of greenhouse gases). Now it’s intensifying, because we’re emitting a lot of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id="do-greenhouse-gases-just-affect-the-atmosphere-">Do greenhouse gases just affect the atmosphere?</h2>
<p>No, greenhouse gases also interact with the biosphere and the hydrosphere. It’s how the climate system maintains balance and stability. Plant matter absorbs CO2 and gives back oxygen. The ocean also absorbs a lot of CO2, in fact every second to third breath that you take is thanks to the oxygen that the oceans provide us with.  </p>
<h2 id="what-s-ocean-acidification-">What’s ocean acidification?</h2>
<p>The CO2 that the oceans absorb dissolves into the water as carbonic acid. It’s sort of like what happens when soda water goes flat and it leaves a yucky taste in your mouth. That’s extra acidity, and it’s happening to our oceans too, at a rate ten times faster that at any point in the last 55 million years. That extra carbonic acid competes with the key building blocks that make up life in the oceans—calcium carbonate. It means that shellfish, and other aquatic life with calcium carbonate shells are less able to reproduce and survive. Ocean acidification poses a serious threat to the aquatic food chain, and the collapse of the aquatic ecosystem threatens life on Earth too. </p>
<h2 id="okay-but-is-it-really-that-bad-if-the-climate-gets-a-few-degrees-warmer-">Okay, but is it really <em>that bad</em> if the climate gets a few degrees warmer?</h2>
<p>It’s not the difference between a 25 degree day, and a 27 degree day, it’s about the whole climate system operating at a higher temperature. It means the frequency and intensity of severe weather increases, and it means weather becomes all the more unpredictable. The repercussions affect the entire biosphere, from disrupting migration patterns, to mass extinctions, and it affects the biosphere that we cultivate too; agriculture. </p>
<h2 id="is-climate-change-affecting-our-planet-already-">Is climate change affecting our planet already?</h2>
<p>Yes. Changes are already happening. The average global temperature has already increased by 1.1˚C above pre-industrial levels. Our boldest targets limit warming by 1.5˚C, but we aren’t on track to meet them. That means we’re going from bad to worse if we continue on with business as usual.</p>
<h2 id="should-we-just-plant-more-trees-">Should we just plant more trees?</h2>
<p>Yes, we should plant more trees, but it’s more complicated than that. We know that older trees have a better capacity to absorb and store carbon, so it doesn’t make sense that we are chopping (and burning) them down at the rate we are. Deforestation doesn’t fit well into our goal of limiting temperature rise. But there’s also so much more we can and should do to keep our ecosystems alive. </p>
<h2 id="is-it-too-late-">Is it too late?</h2>
<p>No. Sure, it’s too late to keep our temperature from rising 1˚C above the pre-industrial average, but it’s not too late for 1.5˚C. Even if we blow past that, or go beyond 2 or 3˚C, there will continue to be a planet and a future left to fight for. You cannot give in to doom. You cannot give up on the world.</p>
