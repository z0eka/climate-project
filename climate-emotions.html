<h1 id="i-m-feeling-anxious">Coping with Climate Emotions</h1>
<p>If you're feeling distressed, that’s understandable. We’re talking about big stuff here. It’s important to take care of yourself when you’re processing the complex feelings that come up in response to the climate crisis. </p>
<p>Feeling distressed is a completely normal reaction, but it’s not something you can sustain for long. Burnt out people can’t save a burning planet, so it’s important to take care of yourself.</p>
<p>Here are some things that might help you. But <a href="#if-you-are-in-a-crisis-the-following-resources-can-provide-you-with-immediate-help">if you are in a crisis, click here instead.</a></p>
<h2 id="move-your-body">Move Your Body</h2>
<p>There are so many benefits to staying active, but moving your body is also a great way of boosting your mental health. Exercise doesn’t have to involve a gym, or an excessive amount of sweat and a turbo playlist. It can be as simple as going for a stroll.</p>
<h3 id="yoga">Yoga</h3>
<p>You might think that yoga is only for a certain stereotype of wellness people. But you don’t have to have a linen wardrobe to participate and reap the rewards. Yoga is a somatic practice, which brings awareness to your internal experience, and makes your unconscious, conscious.  </p>
<p>Going to a studio is a nice way of connecting to your local community, and the experience of practising with a group of people almost always beats doing virtual classes on your own, but it is expensive, and a barrier to access for many people. Below are some free online classes for you to try out.</p>

<h3 id="walking">Walking</h3>
<p>Whether it’s around the block, or out on a trail, walking regularly can help ease symptoms related to depression and anxiety. This is a simple thing you can build into your routine to bolster your resilience.</p>
<h3 id="literally-any-other-exercise-you-enjoy">Literally any other exercise you enjoy</h3>
<p>Whether it’s a team sport, swimming laps, or riding your bike, every exercise comes with benefits for your mind too. It can be hard to get up and get active when you’re in a rut, so start small and go easy on yourself. </p>
<h2 id="mindfulness">Mindfulness</h2>
<p>Yes, I know, everyone yammers on about how mindfulness is so good for your mental health. It can be surprisingly difficult, but it’s a deceptively effective way of slowing down a racing mind, and breaking you out of a spiral.</p>
<p>There are plenty of online meditation apps, but our favourite is Insight Timer. It has over 130,000 guided meditations freely available. Here are a few climate-conscious meditations.</p>
<p><a href="https://insighttimer.com/tarabrach/guided-meditations/open-hearted-presence">Open-Hearted Presence</a></p>
<p><a href="https://insighttimer.com/insighttimerearth/guided-meditations/day-4-eco-challenge-accepting-grief">Accepting Eco-Grief</a></p>
<p>Do you need a little more oomph than a fifteenish minute audio recording can provide? For a more thorough immersion, you can give a meditation retreats a try. You can see what’s available locally to you, or participate in online retreat too.</p>
<h2 id="climate-aware-therapy">Climate-aware Therapy</h2>
<p>Seeing a trained professional is often the best option for dealing with complex emotions. Psychology for a Safe Climate has <a href="https://www.psychologyforasafeclimate.org/cap-directory/">a directory of climate aware practitioners</a>, who have a high level of awareness about the reality of climate change and the stress it can cause. </p>
<h2 id="online-programs-to-work-through-emotions">Online Programs to Work Through Emotions</h2>

<h3 id="-the-work-that-reconnects-https-workthatreconnects-org-network-connect-"><a href="https://workthatreconnects.org/network/connect/">The Work That Reconnects</a></h3>

<h2 id="being-out-in-nature">Being out in Nature</h2>
<p>Humans have a fundamental need for the natural world. The connection between body, mind, spirit and nature has been understood intuitively for millennia, and is now being backed up by science, the benefits are profound. Get yourself to your local green space, whether it’s a creek, public gardens, or a national park. </p>
<h2 id="local-activist-spaces">Local Activist Spaces</h2>
<p>If you’re involved in grassroots activism, then you’re probably in touch with other people who also feel emotionally overwhelmed by the climate crisis. See if there are meetups dedicated to discussing these feelings, and if there aren’t, it might be a good idea to organise one yourself. </p>
<p>You can learn facilitation skills from <a href="https://www.goodgriefnetwork.org/10-steps/#facilitation">Good Grief Network</a> or <a href="https://workthatreconnects.org/facilitators/how-to-become-a-facilitator/">The Work That Reconnects</a>.</p>
<p>A great thing about being involved in activism is being part of the solution, not just treating the symptom of climate dread. Movements that centre climate-justice play a crucial role in shaping a better world for us all. You can find a list of activist organisations to get involved with here. </p>
<h2 id="self-care">Self-care</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.” — Audre Lorde</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are in this for the long-haul. It is not a sprint. Prioritise taking care of yourself in a generative way so that you can continue to contribute to a cleaner, greener and fairer world. </p>
