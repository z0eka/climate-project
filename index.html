  <p>The scale of climate change can feel overwhelming. And in a world of almost eight billion people, it’s easy to feel insignificant.</p>
  <p>In 2018, the IPCC released its special report stating we have twelve years left to limit climate catastrophe.</p>
  <p>It doesn’t mean that the world will implode in 2030. It means that we need to be drastically reducing our emissions, and transitioning away from fossil fuels, if we want to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>
  <p>The science is clear. There is still time to act, and there is still life to save.</p>
  <p>But there’s a prevailing sense of doom among us.</p>
  <p>Climate anxiety is abundant—and it’s a healthy and normal response to the existential threat facing our civilisation.</p>
  <p>But we can’t fall victim to doom. It’s as dangerous as denialism if it only leads us to giving up.</p>
  <p>You can feel grief, fear, and anger. And you can channel that into action. Because there are so many ways to save the world.</p>
